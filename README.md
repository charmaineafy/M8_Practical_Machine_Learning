## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement for a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. This project will use data collected by accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. The participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har> (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

## Goal of Project

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the participants did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. The project aims to find the other relevant variables to predict the "classe" outcome. This project comes with a writeup report to describe how the models are built, how cross validation is used, what the expected out of sample error is, and why the choice of the final prediction model. The final prediction model is used to predict 20 different test cases, and the results are stored in the `results` folder .
